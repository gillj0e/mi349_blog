            <h3>Cookie Recipie</h3>

            <p>Okay so the only annoying thing with this recipe is that if you really want it to be good you have to make the dough and then put it in the fridge for like two days. It helps the salt and butter and sugar mix and develop and it also firms up the cookie by cooling down the butter. You could make this recipe by putting the dough in the fridge for 2-6 hrs but I would recommend the full 48.</p>
            <p>Makes 12-16 cookies</p>

            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <pre>

2. Thoroughly cream together butter and sugar. This should take 5 min if done by hand.
3. Add in eggs and vanilla. Beat till combined.
4. Mix in flour, baking soda, salt and baking soda.
5. Mix in chocolate
6. Transfer dough to fridge safe container to chill.
7. Line a baking sheet with parchment and preheat oven to 365f. 
8. Make dough rounds that are roughly 1.5 in round.
9. Rounds will expand to be 2.5-3 in after baking, keep this in mind when placing rounds on the sheet.
10. Once yours sheets are ready place them in the fridge or freezer until they are ready to go in the oven. This helps the dough cook more thoroughly.
